# TripSync
The current methods of planning a trip can be very complicated and time consuming, especially for those that travel in groups. For those who choose not to put their effort into planning, the alternative can be costly and often not recommended as the trip itself is already expensive. 

For travelers who are facing such challenges, our service, TripSync, offers an all-in-one solution that streamlines the entire trip planning process, from booking hotels to planning attractions and finding places to eat. TripSync aims to enhance the efficiency in organizing trip plans through improved communication and cost reduction. The assets that support the promise of increase in efficiency are: personalized recommendations, calendar and planner integration, group chat feature, bill splitting, parking and gas price finder. 

To further elevate TripSync and meet the needs of travelers, a hypothesis was formed and tested through customer discovery. This process allowed the team to gather feedback from the potential consumers and also understand their pain points on the current trip planning methods, allowing us to further refine our solution in order to transform their pain into gains.
